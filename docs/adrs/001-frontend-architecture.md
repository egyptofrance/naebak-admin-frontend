# ADR-001: Frontend Architecture and Technology Stack

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**

The Naebak platform requires a modern, responsive frontend application that can serve citizens, candidates, and administrators with different needs and access levels. We needed to choose a technology stack that would provide excellent user experience, maintainability, and scalability while supporting the complex requirements of a democratic participation platform. Several approaches were considered, including traditional React SPA, server-side rendered applications, and modern full-stack frameworks.

**Decision:**

We have decided to implement the frontend using Next.js with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, creating a modern, type-safe, and performant web application that serves all user types through a unified interface.

## **Core Technology Decisions:**

**Next.js Framework** provides the foundation for our frontend architecture, offering both client-side and server-side rendering capabilities. This hybrid approach enables optimal performance through static generation for public content while maintaining dynamic capabilities for user-specific features. The App Router provides modern routing with nested layouts and streaming capabilities.

**TypeScript Integration** ensures type safety across the entire frontend codebase, reducing runtime errors and improving developer experience. Type definitions for API responses, component props, and application state provide compile-time validation and excellent IDE support for faster development.

**Tailwind CSS Styling** offers a utility-first approach to styling that promotes consistency and maintainability. The framework provides responsive design capabilities, dark mode support, and a comprehensive design system that can be customized for the Naebak brand while maintaining accessibility standards.

## **Component Architecture:**

**Compound Component Pattern** structures complex UI elements as composable units that can be easily reused and maintained. This pattern is particularly useful for form components, modal dialogs, and data display components that need to support various configurations.

**Feature-Based Organization** groups related components, hooks, and utilities together based on functionality rather than technical concerns. This approach improves code discoverability and makes it easier to maintain features as the application grows.

**Radix UI Primitives** provide accessible, unstyled components that serve as the foundation for custom UI elements. This approach ensures accessibility compliance while maintaining design flexibility and reducing the need to implement complex interaction patterns from scratch.

## **State Management Strategy:**

**React Context for Global State** handles application-wide concerns like authentication, theme preferences, and user settings. This approach provides a simple, built-in solution for state that needs to be accessed across multiple components without the complexity of external state management libraries.

**Custom Hooks for Business Logic** encapsulate reusable stateful logic and API interactions, promoting code reuse and separation of concerns. Hooks like `useAuth`, `useApi`, and `useLocalStorage` provide clean interfaces for common operations while hiding implementation details.

**React Hook Form for Form State** manages form data, validation, and submission with minimal re-renders and excellent performance. The integration with Zod schema validation provides type-safe form handling with comprehensive error management.

## **API Integration Architecture:**

**Axios HTTP Client** handles all API communication with the backend services through the central gateway. Request and response interceptors manage authentication tokens, error handling, and request/response transformation consistently across the application.

**Custom API Hooks** abstract API calls into reusable hooks that handle loading states, error conditions, and data caching. This pattern provides a consistent interface for data fetching while enabling easy testing and mocking during development.

**Type-Safe API Interfaces** define TypeScript interfaces for all API requests and responses, ensuring compile-time validation of data structures and reducing integration errors between frontend and backend systems.

## **Performance and User Experience:**

**Progressive Web App Features** enable app-like experiences with offline capabilities, push notifications, and installable interfaces. Service workers provide caching strategies for static assets and API responses, ensuring the application remains functional even with poor network connectivity.

**Image Optimization** leverages Next.js built-in image optimization to automatically serve appropriately sized images with modern formats like WebP. This reduces bandwidth usage and improves loading times, particularly important for users on mobile networks.

**Code Splitting and Lazy Loading** automatically split the application into smaller bundles that are loaded on demand. This reduces initial page load times and ensures users only download the code they need for their current interaction.

## **Accessibility and Internationalization:**

**WCAG 2.1 Compliance** ensures the application is accessible to users with disabilities through proper semantic HTML, keyboard navigation support, screen reader compatibility, and appropriate color contrast ratios.

**RTL Language Support** accommodates Arabic text direction with proper layout adjustments, text alignment, and component mirroring. The design system supports both LTR and RTL layouts seamlessly.

**Responsive Design** provides optimal user experience across all device sizes using mobile-first design principles. The interface adapts to different screen sizes while maintaining functionality and usability.

## **Development and Deployment:**

**TypeScript Strict Mode** enforces strict type checking to catch potential errors at compile time. This includes strict null checks, no implicit any types, and comprehensive type coverage across the codebase.

**ESLint and Prettier Integration** maintains consistent code style and catches potential issues during development. The configuration includes Next.js specific rules and accessibility linting to ensure code quality.

**Automated Testing Strategy** includes unit tests for utility functions and hooks, integration tests for complex user flows, and end-to-end tests for critical user journeys. The testing setup uses Jest and React Testing Library for comprehensive coverage.

**Consequences:**

**Positive:**

*   **Developer Experience**: TypeScript and modern tooling provide excellent development experience with fast feedback and error prevention.
*   **Performance**: Next.js optimizations and modern web technologies ensure fast loading times and smooth user interactions.
*   **Maintainability**: Component-based architecture and TypeScript make the codebase easy to understand, modify, and extend.
*   **User Experience**: Progressive Web App features and responsive design provide excellent user experience across all devices and network conditions.
*   **Accessibility**: Built-in accessibility features and WCAG compliance ensure the platform is usable by all citizens.

**Negative:**

*   **Learning Curve**: The modern technology stack requires developers to be familiar with Next.js, TypeScript, and modern React patterns.
*   **Build Complexity**: The sophisticated build process and optimization features add complexity to the deployment pipeline.
*   **Bundle Size**: Rich feature set and comprehensive UI components may result in larger initial bundle sizes compared to simpler approaches.

**Implementation Notes:**

The current architecture prioritizes developer experience and user experience over simplicity. Future enhancements could include micro-frontend architecture for better team scalability, advanced caching strategies for improved performance, and integration with external analytics and monitoring tools. The modular design allows for these improvements without major architectural changes.
